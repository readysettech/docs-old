# ReadySet Docs Code of Conduct

We value the participation of everyone in the ReadySet community and want to create an environment that is welcoming, enjoyable, and fulfilling. When posting or participating in a community event or online forum, please use the following guidelines:

- Be specific and detailed. Include relevant details in your inquiries (eg. versions, error messages, deployment environment, etc.), and avoid asking off-topic questions in existing discussion threads.
- Share experiences and knowledge publicly. Everyone can benefit from the exchange of knowledge, so we encourage all community members to share their experience in public channels (on the [ReadySet Community Discord](https://discord.gg/readyset), [GitHub](https://github.com/readysettech), etc.).
- Collaborate and help each other. If someone lacks knowledge in a particular area, help to educate and collaborate with them.
- Have patience. Many community members are volunteers, and it may take some time to get a response to your question.
- Be kind and respectful. Communication should be positive and constructive. Every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs, and there is seldom a right answer.
- Be good to each other. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone.
  Likewise any spamming, trolling, or baiting is not welcome.
- Finally, if you notice or are experiencing violations of this code of conduct or harassment of any kind, please reach out to **`@jseldess`** on GitHub or email  **`info@readyset.io`** to help resolve the situation.

  Thank you for helping make this a helpful and a welcoming community.
