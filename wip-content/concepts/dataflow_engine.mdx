# ReadySet Internals

The heart of ReadySet is a query engine. This query engine, however, is very different from those of 
traditional relational databases in that it is based on **partially-stateful, streaming dataflow**. 

What's that? Let's break it down. First, we'll take a look at the basics of **streaming dataflow**, then 
we'll consider how to make streaming dataflow **stateful**, and then we'll make the state **partial**. 

## Streaming Dataflow 
The basic premise of [streaming dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing) is that a series 
of operations is applied to each element of a stream (a given a sequence of data). 

#### Stream

The stream that ReadySet deals with is a the sequence of data changes made to your underlying database due to writes. 
ReadySet receives this stream as input by registering itself as a [read replica of your primary database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/replication.html). 
The data change stream primarily consists of **inserts of new records** to the base tables and **updates of 
existing records** in the base tables.  

#### Operations 

ReadySet applies SQL operations over this data change stream to compute the results of the SQL queries you give it. 
Specifically, given a SQL query, ReadySet creates a query plan (i.e., the ordered sequence of transformations over the data in 
the base tables that needs to be applied to compute the correct query result) and instantiates a long-lived **dataflow graph** that 
actually executes the operations in the query plan over the incoming data stream. 

#### Example 

For example, let's say we have a table like this one– we'll call it the `Votes` table:
| VoteID | Story |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | "Intro to Streaming Dataflow" |
| 2 | "ReadySet 101" |
| 3 | "Caching in the Wild" |
| 4 | "ReadySet 101" |

We want to compute the following SQL query, using the information in the `Votes` table: 

``` SELECT Story, COUNT(*) FROM Votes GROUP BY Story;```

To perform this computation via streaming dataflow, ReadySet breaks the query down into its constituent operations, 
in the order they must be applied to ensure a correct result. ReadySet then creates a graph that represents this plan: 

`Votes` table ==> `GROUP BY Story` ==> `PROJECT(Story, COUNT(*) AS VoteCount)` 

Each operation in this chain is its own logical node in the graph. The `==>` indicates edges between the nodes
through which data streams. In this case, the rows in the `Votes` table are first grouped by the `Story` column (`GROUP BY Story`), 
and then the number of elements in each group is counted (`COUNT(*) AS VoteCount`), and then finally the vote counts for each 
`Story` is returned.  

Once this graph is created, to compute the final result, we'll stream all of the records in the `Votes` table 
through this graph. Each node will execute its associated function over incoming data, and send the result of the
operation downstream to its children nodes. By the time this process completes, we'll have the final query result. 

==> `Votes` table 
| VoteID | Story |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | "Intro to Streaming Dataflow" |
| 2 | "ReadySet 101" |
| 3 | "Caching in the Wild" |
| 4 | "ReadySet 101" |

==> `GROUP BY Story` 

| VoteID | Story |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | "Intro to Streaming Dataflow" |
| 2 | "ReadySet 101" |
| 3 | "ReadySet 101" |
| 4 | "Caching in the Wild" |

==> `PROJECT(Story, COUNT(*) AS VoteCount)`

| Story | VoteCount |
| --- | ----------- |
| "Intro to Streaming Dataflow" | 1 |
| "ReadySet 101" | 2 |
| "Caching in the Wild" | 1 |

## Stateful Streaming Dataflow 



## Partially-Stateful Streaming Dataflow 

Given a prepared statement, the dataflow engine compiles 
that query into a dataflow graph that is responsible for executing that query. The roots of the graph are 
nodes that represent the application base tables (“base table nodes”). 

## Data Change Ingestion 
ReadySet monitors the primary database’s binlogs (log files that contain information about data modifications 
made as the result of users issuing inserts/updates/deletes) and replicates these data changes (“deltas”) to 
the base table nodes. The base table nodes serve as an entry point to the overall dataflow graph: once deltas 
enter the base tables nodes, they then propagate down through any outgoing edges connected to these nodes, passing 
through other children nodes until they finally hit the leaf nodes of the graph.

## Graph Composition 
There are two other node types in the graph: internal nodes and reader nodes. Internal nodes are associated with 
SQL operators (i.e., functions from relational algebra like joins, aggregates, projections, and filters). They each 
compute their associated function on incoming deltas, and maintain internal state representing the results of their 
function. Whenever their internal state changes (e.g., whenever they receive new deltas that cause their function 
output to change), these nodes emit new deltas that represent these changes, and send them down outgoing edges to 
any children nodes.

Queries can be decomposed into constituent SQL operations, and internal nodes are chained together in a way that 
represents this query. The resulting dataflow graphs look similar to traditional database query plans, but since 
they are materialized in memory, they are optimized in a different way. The leaf nodes of the graph, referred to as 
reader nodes, cache the final query results. Reader nodes can be replicated on arbitrary machines in the same region 
or in different ones.

As writes occur, the resulting data changes are immediately replicated to ReadySet. ReadySet incrementally updates the 
cached query results to reflect these changes. This automatic cache result repair mechanism replaces any developer-written 
cache eviction logic.

## Example Application: Hacker News
To illustrate these concepts, we will walk through an example of using ReadySet for a news forum application inspired 
by HackerNews.

### Schema 
```SQL
CREATE TABLE stories (id int, author text, title text, url text);
```
```SQL
CREATE TABLE votes (user int, story_id int);
```
### Query 
```SQL 
SELECT id, author, title, url, vcount
FROM stories
JOIN (SELECT story_id, COUNT(*) AS vcount 
            FROM votes GROUP BY story_id) 
AS VoteCount
ON VoteCount.story_id = stories.id WHERE stories.id = ?;
``` 
Let’s break this query down further: the VoteCount subquery counts all of the votes associated with each story, and 
returns them along with the story ID. From there, we join the VoteCount results with the stories table on story ID to 
combine all of the raw info about the story with its computed vote count. The results of the JOIN node then pass through 
the > filter on vcount. To then get the result of this query for a given story ID 4, you would instantiate it and replace 
the ? parameter with 4. We will refer to this parameter as the key.

### Caching Query Results with ReadySet 
Traditional databases would compute the results of this query from scratch every time it was issued. ReadySet takes a 
different approach and instead precomputes and incrementally maintains the results of this query for commonly read keys.

To accomplish this, ReadySet creates a streaming dataflow graph, as described in the previous section. Under the hood, the 
dataflow graph would look as follows:

Next, we’ll take a look at what happens when the data changes. Let’s say that we add a record to the Votes table to reflect 
the fact that Justin voted for the story with ID 2. This update would first be applied to the Votes base table at the root 
of the graph, and then be propagated through the graph, updating all children nodes along that way. Figure 7 below shows the 
modified state at each node as the result of this write.

The leaf nodes of the query graph (referred to as Readers in the figures) cache the final query results. When users issue queries, 
the queries are routed directly to these reader nodes. Under the hood, these nodes are represented by special data structures that 
are optimized for low latency access and to support many users accessing it once.
