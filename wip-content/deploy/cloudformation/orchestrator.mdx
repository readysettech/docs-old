# CloudFormation Deployment via the ReadySet Orchestrator
You can configure and deploy a ReadySet cluster to a specified AWS account using the ReadySet orchestrator. The orchestrator 
automatically checks that all of the prerequisites are met for each step in the deployment process. If a prerequisite is not met, 
the orchestrator requests to make the change on your behalf.

If you are interested in trying out ReadySet, but not yet using it in a production environment, we recommend using the ReadySet orchestrator to set up your cluster.
